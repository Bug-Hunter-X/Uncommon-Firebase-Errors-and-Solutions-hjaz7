The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an error if the user's email address is not properly formatted or if there are issues with the Firebase project's configuration.  Additionally, a common error arises when attempting to access data before the data has completely loaded. Asynchronous operations are frequent with Firebase, thus causing race conditions if not handled properly.  Finally, issues with security rules can block legitimate access, or conversely, permit unauthorized access to data.
